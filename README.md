# British Airways Reviews Analysis
This project is the Data Science virtual Internship offered by Forage collaborated with British Airways. The main purpose of this project is to analyse the reviews given by british airways customers and provide insights regarding those reviews.

# The project is divided into 2 parts / tasks
Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights
Task 2 - Build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour

# Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights.

I had scraped and collected the data which is the reviews or feedback of the British Airwaysâ€™ customers from a website called Skytrax.  
The data included all the positive and negative feedback given by customers in their journey with British Airways and then analyzed the data, This process also included data cleaning as the data was bit messy.

I had to install many packages like numpy, pandas, requests, beautifulsoup and html5lib, matplotlib.pyplot, os, seaborn, wordcloud, nltk, spacy.

# Task 2 - Build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour.

In this particular task, I had analysed the data set which was collected from task 1. And then trained a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. After training the model, evaluated how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics. Furthermore, created a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributed to the model.
