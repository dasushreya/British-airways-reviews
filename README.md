# Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights.

I had scraped and collected the data which is the reviews or feedback of the British Airwaysâ€™ customers from a website called Skytrax.  
The data included all the positive and negative feedback given by customers in their journey with British Airways and then analyzed the data, This process also included data cleaning as the data was bit messy.

I had to install many packages like numpy, pandas, requests, beautifulsoup and html5lib.
